## Introduction
This is an interpretation of the classic arcade game Frogger[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger]. It has been created for the Udacity Front End Developer course and utilised code and resources provided by Udacity. The code in app.js has been modified by me.

## Instructions
The aim of the game is to successfully navigate your character from the grass at the bottom of the board to the water at the top. Enemy bugs will generate at different speeds that you muse avoid. If you successfully reach the water you score a point and the game resets but collide with a bug and you will lose all your points.

# How to Run
Download the files and open the index.html file in a browser of our choice.

# How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move the character. You can move up, down, left and right and are limited to the edges of the game board. The grass blocks are safe but bugs will charge across the road at varying speeds. Avoid them to reach the water and you will win a point.

## Acknowledgments
Udacity provided the original index, engine, resources and the basic beginning for the app.js files for student to develop into a working game.
